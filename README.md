# AI_tutor_chatbot ðŸ“šðŸ¤–
This project demonstrates how to use the [`google/gemma-2b-it`](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b-it) language model as an expert tutor that explains machine learning concepts. It combines **prompt engineering** with powerful large language models to generate educational outputs.


## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Uses **structured prompts** to guide the LLM to:
- Provide a summary
- Extract key terms
- Generate Q&A flashcards

âœ… Loads the Gemma-2B-IT model from Hugging Face  
âœ… Designed as an AI tutor for machine learning concepts

## âš¡ Prompt Engineering

The core of this project is a carefully designed prompt template that instructs the model to behave like a tutor. Example snippet:

ðŸ’¡ Example
Input concept:Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient...
Output generated by the chatbot includes:

- A summary of gradient descent

- Key terms

- Q&A flashcards to test understanding
